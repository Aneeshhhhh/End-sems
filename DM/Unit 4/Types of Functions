A function is a rule that assigns each element of a set A(domain) to exactly one
element of a set B(co-domain)
Terms:
1. Domain : The set of all input values for which the func is defined
2. Co-domain : The set of all possible output values
3. Range : The actual set of outputs obtained from the function

Types of Functions:
1. Injective(One to One): Every element in the co=domain is mapped out by at most
one element from the domain

2. Surjective(Onto) : Every element in the co-domain is mapped out by at least
one element from the domain

3. Bijective(One to one and Onto) : A function that is both injective and surjective.
