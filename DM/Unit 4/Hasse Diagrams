A Hasse Diagram is a graphical representation of a partially ordered set(poset). It helps
visualize the relationships between elements in the set based on a partial order.

Key concepts : 
A. Poset : A poset is a set P with a binary relation <= that satisfies:
1. Reflexive : a<=a for all a âˆˆ P
2. Anti-symmetric: If a<=b and b<=a then a=b
3. Transitive : If a<=b and b<=c then a<=c
