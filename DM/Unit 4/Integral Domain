An integral domain is a specific type of Ring in algebraic structures that satisfies 
additional properties to prevent zero divisors.

It has the following properties:
1. Commutative
2. Existence of Identity(Multiplicative) : a*1 = a
3. No zero divisors : If a,b âˆˆ R and a*b = 0 then either a = 0 or b = 0
