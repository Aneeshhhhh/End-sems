A field is a set F equipped with two operations:
Tke numbers 2 and 3
1. Addition
2. Multiplication

These operations must satisfy:
Commutativity: a+b = b+a and a*b=b*a
Asociativity: a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c and a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c
Identity element:
0 is the additive identity : a+0=a
1 is the multiplicative identity : a*1=a

Inverse element : 
Additive : a+(-a)=0
Multiplicative : a
Distributivity : a*(b+c) = (a*b)+(a*c)
