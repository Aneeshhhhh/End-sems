Semigroup : A group that consist of a set S and a binary operation that satisifies the associative propery.
S  = {1, 2, 3}
Binary Operation: A rule that combines two elements in S to produce another element in S.
Associativity :
For all a,b,c ∈ S : (a*b)*c = a*(b*c)


Monoids : A semigroup that consists of an identity element. It satisfies the following:
1. Associativity : derived from the semigroup
2. Identity element : There exists such an element e ∈ M such that for all a ∈ M, 
e*a = a*e = a. For example, if e is 0

Groups : A group is a monoid that also has an inverse for every element. It satisfies:
1. Associativity : Derived from semi group
2. Identity Element : Derived from monoid
3. Inverse Element : a*a^-1 = a^-1*a = e   E is the identity element

Abelian Group : An Abelian group is a group that satisfies the commutative property
along with the group propoerties. It satisfies:
1. Associativity
2. Identity Element
3. Inverse Element
4. Commutavity : For all a,b ∈ G, 
a*b = b*a
The order of operation matters for these groups.

Permutation Group: A permutation group is a set of all permutations of a given set,
equipped with the operation of composition.
Key properties:
1. Closure : Combining two permuts results in another permut
2. Associativity : f o (g o h) = (f o g) o h
3. Identity element
4. Inverse : Every permut has an inverse which undoes the permutation
