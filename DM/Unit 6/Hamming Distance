Hamming Distance Problems:
Hamming distance is the number of dissimilar bits in two codewords.

Compare each codeword and write the distance in the table

If the problem is of 10 codes, the table will be of 10
with the first code word having 4, then 3, 2 and 1 and the 5th element would be on the last 2 of the codeword 2 side 
because it has been compared with everything else before
