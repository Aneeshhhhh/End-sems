 Find the Eulerâ€™s Totient function of the following numbers :
 i) 13
 ii) 81
 iii)120

1. If the number is prime, then 13-1=12 is the answer
2. If the number is not prime, find such numbers that when multiplied equal to it, preferably the ones with exponentials.
Therefore, 81 can be written as 3^4
The formula is that 81*(1-(1/the base number or 3)) = 54

3. For 120, the numbers will be 2^3*3*5
so by using the formula, we will get 32

It is important to note that to get the lower numbers, just divide the number by the most probable number you think and find number that when multiplied, are the quotients
