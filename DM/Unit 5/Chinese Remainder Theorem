X = 2 mod 3 (If X/3, the remainder is 2)
X = 4 mod 5
X = 2 mod 7
values like these will be given

the multiplication of all the mod-after's(3*5*7) is the limit of combinations

These equations are interpreted as
X=3k+2
X=5k+4
X=7k+2

Pick the last value and assign k = 0, 1, 2 so on until it reaches the limit of combinations
Then from, the list of values, find the values that can be divided by 3 and leave 2 as remainder.

After finding those values, use the first equation to short them even further
Then the least common value is the answer or X
