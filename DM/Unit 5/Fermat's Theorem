Perform p-1 on the exponential
then write the result on the exponential as an equation
divide the p-1 from the actual exponential
write it in quotient and remainder form
write those numbers of quotient and remainder in terms of power of the base number
represent it in (a*b)mod n form
a will be 1 from the 2nd line equation
