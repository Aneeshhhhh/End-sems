 List all the congruence class modulo 6. List at least 3 elements to left as
 well as right of the modulo class k (where k = 0 to n-1)

For this problem, the equation is 
6n+k
k = 0 to n-1
n is determined by "at least 3 elements to left and right"

class k modulo 6
write in this format

class 0 modulo 6: 
-12, -6, 0, 6, 12

class 1 modulo 6:
-11, -5, 1, 7, 13
