A graph is a mathematical structure used to model connections between pairs or objects.
It consists of:
A. Vertices:
1. These are the individual points or nodes in the graph.
2. In a graph, there are n vertices

B. Edges:
These are the lines that form connections between vertices
2. 

Based on Direction:

Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction, meaning the relationship is mutual

Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction, represented as an arrow 
Based on Connectivity:

Connected Graph: There is a path between every pair of vertices.
Disconnected Graph: Some vertices are isolated or unreachable.

Special Types:

Weighted Graph: Each edge has a weight or value (e.g., distance, cost).
Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle (a closed path).
Acyclic Graph: Contains no cycles.


Self-loops: It is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.
A self-loop increases the degree of the vertex by 2 (one for entering and one for leaving the vertex).


Parallel edges: are two or more edges that connect the same pair of vertices.
