MAX FLOW = MIN CUT
Max flow:
Take the most direct paths and then proceed to cover all paths
After you've passed through a path, subtract the lowest value of the path from all the existing values of the path
If you encounter a path in which a value is 0, consider that path blocked

Record the lowest values for each path
Add them up, that is the max flow value

Min flow:
Make the same strucutre of the graph with the 0s of the max flow
find a way to cut the sink off the graph
choose any of the 0 vertices and then cut them 
add the values of the cut vertices
that is the min cut value
