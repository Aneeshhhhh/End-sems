Hamiltonian Path: A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a graph that visits each vertex
exactly once. The focus is entirely on visiting all the vertices.
Edges may be repeated

Eulerian Path : Traverses every edge once
Vertices may be repeated.


Hamiltonian Graph : A Hamiltonian graph is a graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
This means that there exists a closed loop in the graph that visits every vertex exactly 
once and then returns to the starting vertex.

Key Features of a Hamiltonian Graph:
1. Every vertex is visited exactly once in the cycle.
2. The edges in the cycle form a closed loop.
3. Not all edges of the graph need to be used.


Eulerian Graph : An Eulerian graph is a graph in which there exists a Eulerian Cycle.
It is a closed path that visits every edge in the graph exactly once.

Key Features of an Eulerian Graph:
1. Every edge is traversed exactly once.
2. Vertices can be revisited.
For an undirected graph:
1. Every vertex must have an even degree (even number of edges connected to it).
For a directed graph:
1. Each vertex must have the same in-degree and out-degree
