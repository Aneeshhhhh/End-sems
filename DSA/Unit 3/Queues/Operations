Enqueue : Inserting an element on the rear side of the queue.

Approach:
ENQUEUE(queue, element)
if rear == capacity - 1
print Queue Overflow
else 
front = 0
rear = rear +1
queue[rear] = element

Dequeue : Deleting and returning the front end element

Approach : 
DEQUEUE(queue)
if front == -1 or front > rear
print Underflow
if front == rear;
front = rear = -1
else 
front = front + 1
